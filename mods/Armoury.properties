#This section allows you to configure the armour damage reduction values for each armour type. The values displayed here are the damage reduction multiplier at 100QL, scaling down using the Wurm formula.
# For example: plate is by default 0.7, giving 70% damage reduction to incoming attacks for a 100QL steel plate set.
# I have my own personal tastes when it comes to the armour reduction, so I will leave the default configuration commented out if you wish to use it, then include my personal setup.
# Final note: Unarmoured reduction is applied to most creatures, and scales using Oakshell. While the option is here, I recommend leaving it set at the default 0.05.

# -- Shield Configuration Section -- #
#enableShieldDamageEnchants: This will allow AOSP to work as a reflector for any damage enchant that is applied to the shield, applying a wound to the attacker on block.
# AOSP acts as the "chance" for the reflect, and the damage applied to it acts as the "type"
# For example, Flaming Aura on a shield would deal a fire wound to an attacker on block when it has AOSP.
enableShieldDamageEnchants=true
#enableShieldSpeedEnchants: This allows WoA and BotD to interact with shields, reducing the "shield block" counter for a round of combat by 1 when the check succeeds.
# This means higher casts of WoA will allow you to block more attacks per round in combat.
enableShieldSpeedEnchants=true

# -- Weapon Configuration Section -- #
#minimumSwingTime: This will change the minimum swing timer for weaponry. By default, this is 3 seconds. That means no weapon can swing faster than once every 3 seconds.
# Now you have the power to change that. This can be set to any value you want (in seconds). When I set it to 0 and made a superfast weapon, the results were terrifying.
minimumSwingTime=2.0
#raresReduceSwingTime: If enabled, this will make rare, supreme, and fantastic weapons reduce the swing timer.
raresReduceSwingTime=true
#rareSwingSpeedReduction: The amount of time, in seconds, per rarity level, that rares should reduce the swing timer.
# Example: A value of 0.2 would make a rare reduce swing time by 0.2 seconds, supreme reduce swing time by 0.4 seconds, and fantastic reduce swing time by 0.6 seconds.
rareSwingSpeedReduction=0.2
#fixSavedSwingTimer: This one is hard to explain. Basically, when an action is performed (a shield bash, spell, etc.) the swing timer continues to tick.
# After the action, the player will swing, removing the "first swing" amount from the timer.
# That leaves the rest of the timer, allowing them to swing yet again almost immediately after, even with a slow weapon.
# This option removes this interaction and enforces a "set timer to 0" after each swing, ensuring that swings with weapons must be spaced apart properly.
# Some players might enjoy the "skill" in performing this type of action.
fixSavedSwingTimer=true
#betterDualWield: THIS IS HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
# Dual wield by default is locked behind a multitude of checks. That includes slower swing speed, "dead time" after landing a hit, and only being used every other "combat round" (~10 seconds).
# This reworks the system, and simply makes an offhand swing 1/2 as slow as the main hand, starting in the second round of combat.
betterDualWield=true

#enableCustomWeaponValues: This will enable or disable the usage of the section below entirely.
enableCustomWeaponValues=true
#This section will allow you to edit the damage, speed, crit chance, reach, weight group, parry percent, and skill penalty of the weapons in Wurm.
#Use the property "weapon" combined with the field capitalized ("Damage", "Speed", etc.), then the weapon id to change, a comma, then new value.
#This must use the weapon id because there are clashes with the name, where both huge and small axe are "axe"
# IMPORTANT NOTE: Ranged weapons (bows) do not work off these changes. They are a separate entity entirely. This is only for melee weapons.
#Here's some of my suggested changes as examples for what you can do:
#> Increase scythe damage to 10 from 9
weaponDamage-1:268,10.4
#> Increase halberd damage to 10.5 from 9
weaponDamage-2:706,11.25
#> Increase long spear damage to 9.5 from 8
weaponDamage-3:705,9.5
#> Increase steel spear damage to 10 from 9
weaponDamage-4:707,10.75
#> Increase steel staff damage to 9 from 8
weaponDamage-5:710,9.5
#> Increase shortsword damage to 5 from 4
weaponDamage-6:80,5.5

#> Increase scythe speed to 4.5 from 5
weaponSpeed-1:268,4.5
#> Increase large maul speed to 5.25 from 6
weaponSpeed-2:290,5.25

#Crit chance uses the decimal as a percent. 1 is a 100% crit chance. 0.05 is a 5% crit chance. The game forces a maximum of 3% crit in the combat code.
#> Give legs a 0.4% chance to crit, just in case you get lucky on your cheap shot
weaponCritChance-1:19,0.004

#Weapon reach determines the distance in combat for "too close" "good" and "too far" - this is an integer value so please don't use decimals.
#> Change planks to 1 range. Just for science and demonstration.
weaponReach-1:22,1

#I actually don't know what the weapon weight group does. I'll be commenting out my change because I don't want to break anything, but the option is there for you risk-takers!
#> Change "whip of One" to weight group 2
#weaponWeightGroup-1:514,2

#The parryPercent value is a factor in how well the weapon parries. Swords get an innate 4x bonus to this value in the combat code. Otherwise, it's a good indicator for how easy it is to parry.
#> Change sickle parry from 20% to 40%
weaponParryPercent-1:267,0.4

#Finally, the skillPenalty is a combat rating debuff applied to the player wearing this in their main hand. A skillPenalty of 2 will reduce the player's CR by 2 in combat just for wearing the weapon.
#While CR is generally considered an integer by the community, it actually works as a floating point value, so decimals do in fact work with skill penalty.
#> Reduce skill penalty on sickle to 1.0 from 2.0. Maybe it's good again?
weaponSkillPenalty-1:267,1.0
#> Reduce skill penalty on scythe to 0.5 from 2.0.
