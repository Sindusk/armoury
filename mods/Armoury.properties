# > Armour Reduction < #
#This section allows you to configure the armour damage reduction values for each armour type. The values displayed here are the damage reduction multiplier at 100QL, scaling down using the Wurm formula.
# For example: plate is by default 0.7, giving 70% damage reduction to incoming attacks for a 100QL steel plate set.
# I have my own personal tastes when it comes to the armour reduction, so I will leave the default configuration commented out if you wish to use it, then include my personal setup.

# Unarmoured reduction is applied to most creatures, and scales using Oakshell. While the option is here, I recommend leaving it set at the default 0.05.

#> Damage Reduction
# **ADDITIVE** damage reduction if the armour is created from this material. This is very specifically what it says after the item.
#  Example: "chain jacket, iron" would use the iron modifier (11). Even if the armour type is different, the material is still used.
#  Example 2: "dragonscale jacket, glimmersteel" would use the dragonscale base armour value and add the glimmersteel property below.
#materialDamageReduction: Additional percentage of damage reduction from material.
# For example, adamantine by default gives 0.05, meaning 5% damage reduction on top the 70% that plate gives.
#  Adamantine plate would give 75% damage reduction at 100QL with this setting.
# Note that if no value is set, the default wurm values will be used.
#  If you want to remove the DR penalty for lead armour, you'll have to use materialDamageReduction-##:12,0.00
# Ensure that each property has it's own unique identifier number and none of them clash.

#fixSavedSwingTimer: This one is hard to explain. Basically, when an action is performed (a shield bash, spell, etc.) the swing timer continues to tick.
# After the action, the player will swing, removing the "first swing" amount from the timer.
# That leaves the rest of the timer, allowing them to swing yet again almost immediately after, even with a slow weapon.

#The parryPercent value is a factor in how well the weapon parries. Swords get an innate 4x bonus to this value in the combat code. Otherwise, it's a good indicator for how easy it is to parry.

weaponParryPercent-1:267,0.4

#Finally, the skillPenalty is a combat rating debuff applied to the player wearing this in their main hand. A skillPenalty of 2 will reduce the player's CR by 2 in combat just for wearing the weapon.
